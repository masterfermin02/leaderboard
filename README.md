# Fullstack, React + Node JS

# Main Goal

Your task is to create a project using React JS that uses a REST API based on Node JS. The Frontend
has to be responsive and the Backend has to handle a database of:
âˆ’ Participants and
âˆ’ Skills.
Note: For React you can use the libraries you prefer in order to accomplish the requirements.

# LeaderBoard

This repo is meant to keep track of the changes made to the frontend and backend of the **Leaderboard** challenge.

## Project  Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

There is no need for the developers to install MongoDB since all this is included in the Docker service.
